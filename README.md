Overview: In recent years, robots have proven to precise, accessible and can integrate into numerous applications, one of which is robot-assistive surgeries. Robots can now be employed, for example, as tools for the purpose of medical diagnosis, surgical suturing (e.g., wound sutures, endoscopic suturing) or performing surgeries as a slave to the master-surgeon. To accomplish such tasks, robots are trained to even make their own decisions or devise procedures on their own. Even though robots have proven to be indispensable in helping surgeons and patients alike, there is still room for expansion and improvement on how robots can perform complex tasks and serving an assistant to surgeons to identify the best treatment plan while in operation. That is, the robots in assistive surgeries require employing advanced decisionmaking techniques to incorporate multi-objective criteria for enhancing their overall operations. In this capstone project, we will investigate the use of multi-criteria decision-making process for improving the operation of robot-assistive surgeries. We plan to employ the TOPSIS algorithm as part of our efforts in using multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) in tasks involving robotics in medical surgeries.
